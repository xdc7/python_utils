# python_utils
General purpose Python utils to make various admin tasks simpler!

This open source project aims to provide system admins with easy to use utlities in Python to make various day to day tasks easier. For example, want to download all your private keys from S3 to your local environmnent any time so that you could SSH into your EC2 instances, just use the aws_get_keys.py script (in progress) and that's it. The script will download the private keys, add them to your local SSH agent so that you could access hosts through agent forwarding. 

This is just one example, but we'll be adding more and more scripts as we go on. Feel free to contribute!
